# Motekim-Search [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mikewlange/35-Super-Fast-Full-Text-Search-Algorithms.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mikewlange/35-Super-Fast-Full-Text-Search-Algorithms)
Tons of search functions written in c. LLVM/Xcode. Will be adding more in the days to come. See tests for now. 

Good Read: https://arxiv.org/abs/1012.2547 # The Algos Note: I snagged these from all over the internet. And a few I came up with. 

It's very simple to use Swift and c side by by side.  

Fun Swift opinion - If you're not low level engineers, you probably don't realize that Swift (or Golang - my new favorite) could easily replace c. But c is awesome. C++ can die already. 

I took the TDD approach on this so every implementation is right in the unit tests. 

These are most of the full text search algos out there I think. 

I even found some esoteric ones that are blazing compared to the "standard" ones. You'll know them by their name as you'll have never heard of it. 

This has been an interesting exercize'. Each one of these excell in specific scenarios. Some more universal than others. Lots of unexpected on specific data types. This is exciting because there is a strong possibility it's quite easy to improve every search platform/algo in existence via simple genetic algos and ML. That's a big one. But in dev. Similar to https://github.com/mikewlange/Kettle--Tpot-for-GPU-AI but for search critera/algo deduction/content. 

Hopefully no one reads that last sentance as you now have a billian dollar search platform if you put in the work before me.  

Here they are in no particular order.
