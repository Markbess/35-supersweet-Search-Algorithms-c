# Motekim-Search [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mikewlange/Motekim-Search.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mikewlange/Motekim-Search)
Tons of search functions written in c. LLVM/Xcode. Will be adding more in the days to come. See tests for now. 

Good Read: https://arxiv.org/abs/1012.2547 # The Algos Note: I snagged these from all over the internet. And a few I came up with. 

I like c and I like swift. Same compiler perfect math. Swift and C are easier than swift and ob-c. But it's very simple to use Swift and c side de by side.  Fun Swift opinion - If you're not low level engineers, you probably don't realize that Swift (or Golang - my new favorite) could easily replace c++ and prob c. But c is awesome. C++ can die already. 

I took the TDD approach on this so every implementation is right in the SearchTests. This is kind of all the non-indexig search algos out there I think. For and ass. Please. That would be cool. 

I even found some esoteric some that are blazing compared to the "standard" ones. You'll know them by their name as you'll have never heard of it. 

This has been an interesting exercize'. Each one of these es cell in specific scenarios. Some more universal than others. Lots of unexpected on specific data types. This is exciting because there is a strong possibility it's quite east to improve every search platform/algo in existence. 

Here they are in no particular order.

I'll write them out later. :)
