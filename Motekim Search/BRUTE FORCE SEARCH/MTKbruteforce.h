//Description
//The brute force algorithm consists in checking, at all positions in the text between 0 and n-m,
//whether an occurrence of the pattern starts there or not. Then, after each attempt,
//it shifts the pattern by exactly one position to the right.

//The brute force algorithm requires no preprocessing phase,
//and a constant extra space in addition to the pattern and the text.
//During the searching phase the text character comparisons can be done in any order.
//The time complexity of this searching phase is O(mn) (when searching for am-1b in an for instance).
