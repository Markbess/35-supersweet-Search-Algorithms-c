// MAIN FEATURES
//+++++++++++++++++++++++++++
//preprocessing phase in constant
//During the searching phase of the Not So Naive algorithm the character comparisons are made with the pattern positions in the following order 1, 2, ... , m-2, m-1, 0.
//
//For each attempt where the window is positioned on the text factor y[j .. j+m-1]: if x[0]=x[1] and x[1] neq y[j+1] of if x[0] neq x[1] and x[1]=y[j+1] the pattern is shifted by 2 positions at the end of the attempt and by 1 otherwise.
//
//Thus the preprocessing phase can be done in constant time and space. The searching phase of the Not So Naive algorithm has a quadratic worst case but it is slightly (by coefficient) sub-linear in the average case.
